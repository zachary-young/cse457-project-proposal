      <h1>The Competitive Landscape of Big Tech Companies</h1>
      <br />

      <h2>Basic Info</h2>
      <br />

      <p>Jakob Braunschweiger: jbraunschweiger@wustl.edu 466081</p>

      <p>Nathan Ostdiek: nathanostdiek@wustl.edu 455650</p>

      <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        We have chosen to visualize the competition amongst tech companies in
        various market sectors in the tech industry. The tech industry has
        dominant companies that compete in multiple industries, from smartphones
        to cloud services to streaming platforms. Our background as Computer
        Science college students and usage of relevant companiesâ€™ products
        almost daily, inspired us to carry out this project. Technology affects
        everyone in the world and that control will continue to grow in the
        future. We are motivated to better understand the competitive
        relationships between companies as their decisions and products will
        influence how we live our lives.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        The primary objective of our visualization is to show competition
        amongst companies in the tech industry in different market segments. We
        want to show the competitive relationships between companies, and for
        each market sector, we plan to show the percentage that each competing
        company has captured. This will help the user understand who is winning
        and losing in each market. Visualizing this data can help provide
        insight into the following questions: Are there too many or too few
        companies in an industry that causes different types of behavior? Is the
        varying levels of competition good for companies? Do companies compete
        against each other in every industry or focus on one specific product?
        Does a company capture smaller market segments in a variety of
        industries or a bigger portion of one industry?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answering these questions will help the user better understand the
        business side of the ever growing technology industry as a whole. It is
        important to know these relationships, as they will shape the next
        generation of products and platforms in our country. Nearly everybody
        owns and uses a product from multiple of the companies displayed in our
        visualization, so it is beneficial to know the competition in the
        market. This knowledge can lead to purchasing better products for the
        user or what to expect for a company in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We set out to find answers to these questions. As a team working
        together, we will learn and get better at wrangling data from scratch,
        creating effective visualizations from this data, and providing an
        intuitive, easy to use format.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <br />

      <p class="text-wrap">
        Since we need data for many subsets of the tech industry, we are going
        to need to use various different sources. While they are not yet totally
        comprehensive, here are the datasets we have found so far, organized by
        the subset of the general technology market they pertain to:

      <h2>Data Processing</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="text-wrap">
        Since we have so many different sources of data, we are going to need to
        do some heavy manual cleanup. Currently, the plan is to decide on a
        structure for the data and then begin moving data from our separate
        sources into a central CSV or JSON document.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        Likely we will have two central documents one with each row representing
        a market segment (e.g. smartphones, computers, cloud computing) and the
        other representing companies. For the segments, we would want to have
        data such as which companies hold market share and what percent. For
        companies, we probably want to store basic data like name, symbol,
        revenue, ect and some more advanced information such as how their
        revenue breaks down into market segments.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        After we have these 2 central sources of information, we can automate
        joining them with a python script before runtime or at runtime with D3,
        depending on how we decide to architect our visualization.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap"></p>
      <br />

      <h2>Visualization Design</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The following four images show some initial ideas we came up regarding
        the competitive landscape of big tech companies. Each image depicts a
        different way to summarize the data. For example, the first image shows
        market share within one particular segment. The second image shows
        revenue breakdown of a particular company. The third image shows market
        share across multiple segments. Finally, the fourth visual shows how
        many segments companies compete with each other across.
      </p>
      <img class="alternative" src="img1.png" />
      <img class="alternative" src="img2.png" />
      <img class="alternative" src="img3.png" />
      <img class="alternative" src="img4.png" />
      <p>
        In the end, we chose to combine some of the features in each of the
        images to produce a comprehensive summary of the data. The primary focus
        of our visualization will be the relations between each of the
        companies. A thicker line indicates that the company competes with the
        other company across many different industries. Moreover, we hope to add
        drill-down capabilities to summarize more specific data, such as data
        within a certain market segment or a certain company. Also, we chose to
        add a comparison function to our bubble graphs as a way to compare
        different companies and sectors without using a stacked bar chart. We
        found that a stacked bar chart would not scale well with a lot of data,
        since the number of companies and market segments could be quite large.
      </p>
      <img class="final" src="img5.png" />
      <p>
        In terms of visual encoding, we chose a circular network-like graph for
        our primary visualization because it was the best way to represent
        connections between different nodes. This highly interconnected data
        could not be represented by other visualizations such as a bar chart or
        line chart. We also chose to concentrate the nodes within a circle for
        the sake of readability.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the bubble charts, we chose area and separate bubbles also for the
        sake of readability. While area is often not the best form of visual
        encoding, we found that a pie chart and a treemap chart would not scale
        well with large quantities of companies and market segments.
        Additionally, bubble charts are fun to interact with, and we could allow
        the user to drag and drop bubbles for a more immersive experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Schedule</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 11/23 - One of us will develop data structures, another will source
        our initial data and conform it to fit our data structures, and the last
        team member will build the first prototype of our main visualization.
        This prototype will display connections between companies on a prototype
        of the main visualization using initial data.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 11/30 - One of us will finish sourcing and cleaning the data, another
        will add logos for the companies and position them correctly in the
        visualization, and the last will work on color coding and adding legend.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 12/7 - One of us will focus on making the elements of the legend
        selectable, update the visualization when that happens. Another will
        focus on making the company logos selectable, update the visualization
        when that happens. The last one will work on the secondary visualization
        (the bar graph that shows more information about what is selected.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 12/14 - This week we will all work on prepping for the final
        presentation. Generating slides, polishing the visualization, and
        practicing our presentation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 12/21 - One of us will take this week to do user testing and figure
        out what needs to change in the final visualization. Another will work
        on finishing up whatever work is left on the secondary visualization.
        The last team member will start adding optional features wherever
        possible.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 12/28 - This week we will all be working on iterating based on the
        user testing notes from the previous week. We will assign specific tasks
        week-of as we do not yet know what the notes will deem as necessary.
      </p>
      <p class="text-wrap">
        By 1/4 - We are leaving this week open in the schedule in case we fall
        behind. If not, we will spend it making final tweaks. At the end of this
        week the project should be completely done.
      </p>
